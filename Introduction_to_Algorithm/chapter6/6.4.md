### 4.1
#### Q 
Using Figure 6.4 as a model, illustrate the operation of HEAPSORT on the array A = [5, 13, 2, 25, 7, 17, 20, 8, 4].
#### A
略
### 4.2
#### Q
Argue the correctness of HEAPSORT using the following loop invariant:

• At the start of each iteration of the for loop of lines 2-5, the subarray A[1...i] is a max-heap containing the i smallest elements of A[1...n], and the subarray A[i + 1...n] contains the n - i largest elements of A[1...n], sorted.
#### A
显而易见，整个堆排序就建立在这上面
### 4.3
#### Q
What is the running time of heapsort on an array A of length n that is already sorted in increasing order? What about decreasing order?
#### A
结论： 堆排序的运行时间一直为O(nlgn)
