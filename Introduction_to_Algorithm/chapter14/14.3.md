## 练习3
### 3.1
#### Q 

Write pseudocode for LEFT-ROTATE that operates on nodes in an interval tree and updates the max fields in O(1) time.
#### A
```cpp
LEFT-ROTATE(T,x)
	//默认已经执行完旋转了，开始维护max
	x.max=max(x.left.max,x.right.max)
	y.max=max(y.left.max,y.right.max)
```

### 3.2
#### Q 
Rewrite the code for INTERVAL-SEARCH so that it works properly when all intervals are assumed to be open.

#### A
```cpp
INTERVAL-SEARCH(T, i)
    x <- root[T]
    while x != nil[T] and i does not overlap int[x]
        do if left[x] != nil[T] and max[left[x]] > low[i]
            then x<-left[x]
            else x<-right[x]
    return x
```

### 3.3
#### Q 
Describe an efficient algorithm that, given an interval i, returns an interval overlapping i that has the minimum low endpoint, or nil[T] if no such interval exists.

#### A
略

### 3.4
#### Q 
Given an interval tree T and an interval i, describe how all intervals in T that overlap i can be listed in O(min(n, k lg n)) time, where k is the number of intervals in the output list. (Optional: Find a solution that does not modify the tree.)

#### A
遍历整个树

### 3.5
#### Q 
Suggest modifications to the interval-tree procedures to support the new operation INTERVAL-SEARCH-EXACTLY(T, i), which returns a pointer to a node x in interval tree T such that low[int[x]] = low[i] and high[int[x]] = high[i], or nil[T] if T contains no such node. All operations, including INTERVAL-SEARCH-EXACTLY, should run in O(lg n) time on an n-node tree.
#### A
略
### 3.6
#### Q 
Show how to maintain a dynamic set Q of numbers that supports the operation MIN-GAP, which gives the magnitude of the difference of the two closest numbers in Q. For example, if Q = {1, 5, 9, 15, 18, 22}, then MIN-GAP(Q) returns 18 - 15 = 3, since 15 and 18 are the two closest numbers in Q. Make the operations INSERT, DELETE, SEARCH, and MIN-GAP as efficient as possible, and analyze their running times.
#### A
在红黑树的基础上，给每个节点增加信息  
每个节点有一个minGap变量存放最小gap，然后还有min和max分别存放其子树的最小关键字和最大关键字。这是用来方便O(1)时间维护minGap使用的。  


### 3.7
#### Q 
VLSI databases commonly represent an integrated circuit as a list of rectangles. Assume that each rectangle is rectilinearly oriented (sides parallel to the x- and y-axis), so that a representation of a rectangle consists of its minimum and maximum x- and y-coordinates. Give an O(n lg n)-time algorithm to decide whether or not a set of rectangles so represented contains two rectangles that overlap. Your algorithm need not report all intersecting pairs, but it must report that an overlap exists if one rectangle entirely covers another, even if the boundary lines do not intersect. (Hint: Move a "sweep" line across the set of rectangles.)
#### A
先根据x坐标排序所有2n个点,然后将一扫描线扫过整个矩形,我们让扫描线和y轴平行,从最左开始扫描.如果碰到某矩形平行y轴的左边那条边条边，就把这条边插入到区间树中，如果碰到某矩形平行y轴的右边那条边，就把这条边从区间树中删除，如果碰到在插入边时，和前面插入的边有重叠，那么就是矩形重叠了.
