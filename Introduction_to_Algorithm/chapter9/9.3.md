## 练习3
### 3.1
#### Q 
In the algorithm SELECT, the input elements are divided into groups of 5. Will the algorithm work in linear time if they are divided into groups of 7? Argue that SELECT does not run in linear time if groups of 3 are used.

#### A
略

### 3.2
#### Q 
Analyze SELECT to show that if n ≥ 140, then at least ⌈n/4⌉ elements are greater than the median-of-medians x and at least ⌈n/4⌉ elements are less than x.

#### A
按书中方法选取出的主元x，至少有3n/10-6个元素小于x，要求n/4个元素小于x，则n满足大于140即可。
### 3.3
#### Q 
Show how quicksort can be made to run in O(nlgn) time in the worst case.

#### A
将快排中的partition算法的主元选择，改成书中提供的方法，选取中位数的中位数，即可。

### 3.4
#### Q 
Suppose that an algorithm uses only comparisons to find the ith smallest element in a set of n elements. Show that it can also find the i - 1 smaller elements and the n - i larger elements without performing any additional comparisons.

#### A
略
### 3.5
#### Q 
Suppose that you have a "black-box" worst-case linear-time median subroutine. Give a simple, linear-time algorithm that solves the selection problem for an arbitrary order statistic.

#### A
每次可以把数组切分成一半。T(n)=T(n/2)+O(n)，故复杂度为O(n)
### 3.6
#### Q 
The kth quantiles of an n-element set are the k - 1 order statistics that divide the sorted set into k equal-sized sets (to within 1). Give an O(n lg k)-time algorithm to list the kth quantiles of a set.

#### A
不能分别找k个顺序统计量，不然时间复杂度为O(kn)。应该先找中间那个，然后对左右区间依次找，注意分奇数和偶数的不同情况。
### 3.7
#### Q 
Describe an O(n)-time algorithm that, given a set S of n distinct numbers and a positive integer k ≤ n, determines the k numbers in S that are closest to the median of S.

#### A
以后寻找一定范围的顺序统计量，都可以用这种方法，找到头尾数，然后遍历数组，得出结果。  

* 计算出中位数median
* 将所有数减去median,再取绝对值
* 用SELECT计算出第k小数字y
* 遍历数组，取出所有绝对值小于等于y的  

### 3.8
#### Q 
Let [1 .. n] and Y [1 .. n] be two arrays, each containing n numbers already in sorted order. Give an O(lg n)-time algorithm to find the median of all 2n elements in arrays X and Y.
#### A
leetcode第四题  
[c++ code](https://github.com/swananan/Wu-Algorithm/blob/master/Leetcode/004_MedianofTwoSortedArrays.cc)  

```
#python代码
def two_array_median(a, b):
    if len(a) == 1:
        return min(a[0], b[0])

    m = median_index(len(a))
    i = m + 1
    if a[m] < b[m]:
        return two_array_median(a[-i:], b[:i])
    else:
        return two_array_median(a[:i], b[-i:])

def median_index(n):
    if n % 2:
        return n // 2
    else:
        return n // 2 - 1
```
### 3.9
#### Q 
Professor Olay is consulting for an oil company, which is planning a large pipeline running east to west through an oil field of n wells. From each well, a spur pipeline is to be connected directly to the main pipeline along a shortest path (either north or south), as shown in Figure 9.2（略）. Given x- and y-coordinates of the wells, how should the professor pick the optimal location of the main pipeline (the one that minimizes the total length of the spurs)? Show that the optimal location can be determined in linear time.
#### A
