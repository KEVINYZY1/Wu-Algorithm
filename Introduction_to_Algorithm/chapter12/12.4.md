#### Q 
Prove equation (12.3).
#### A
略
### 4.2
#### Q 
Describe a binary search tree on n nodes such that the average depth of a node in the tree is Θ(lg n) but the height of the tree is w(lg n). Give an asymptotic upper bound on the height of an n-node binary search tree in which the average depth of a node is Θ(lg n).

#### A
略
### 4.3
#### Q 
Show that the notion of a randomly chosen binary search tree on n keys, where each binary search tree of n keys is equally likely to be chosen, is different from the notion of a randomly built binary search tree given in this section.

#### A
随机选择二叉搜索树，是对n个关键字能构建的所有二叉搜索树进行选择，其中随机的可能性远远小于随机构造二叉搜索树。
### 4.4
#### Q 
Show that the function f(x) = 2^x is convex.

#### A
略
### 4.5
#### Q 
Consider RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT operating on a sequence of n distinct input numbers. Prove that for any constant k > 0, all but O(1/(n^k)) of the n! input permutations yield an O(nlgn) running time.
