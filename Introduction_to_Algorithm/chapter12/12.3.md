### 3.1
#### Q 
Give a recursive version of the TREE-INSERT procedure.

#### A
```cpp
TREE_INSERT(T,z)
    y = NULL;
    x =root[T]
    while x != NULL
        do y =x
            if key[z] < key[x]
                 then x=left[x]
                 else  x=right[x]
     parent[z] =y
     if y=NULL
        then root[T] =z
        else if key[z]>key[y]
                   then  keft[y]  = z
                   else   right[y] =z
```

### 3.2
#### Q 
Suppose that a binary search tree is constructed by repeatedly inserting distinct values into the tree. Argue that the number of nodes examined in searching for a value in the tree is one plus the number of nodes examined when the value was first inserted into the tree.
#### A
查找操作，要比之前插入多比较一次，多出来比较的那一次就是被查找的那个节点
### 3.3
#### Q 
We can sort a given set of n numbers by first building a binary search tree containing these numbers (using TREE-INSERT repeatedly to insert the numbers one by one) and then printing the numbers by an inorder tree walk. What are the worst-case and best-case running times for this sorting algorithm?
#### A
和快排一样
### 3.4
#### Q 
Is the operation of deletion "commutative" in the sense that deleting x and then y from a binary search tree leaves the same tree as deleting y and then x? Argue why it is or give a counterexample.
#### A
不可以交换
### 3.6
#### Q 
When node z in TREE-DELETE has two children, we could splice out its predecessor rather than its successor. Some have argued that a fair strategy, giving equal priority to predecessor and successor, yields better empirical performance. How might TREE-DELETE be changed to implement such a fair strategy?
#### A
随机选择前驱或者后继来替换被删除的节点。
