## 练习2
### 2.1
#### Q 
Suppose that we have numbers between 1 and 1000 in a binary search tree and want to search for the number 363. Which of the following sequences could not be the sequence of nodes examined?
#### A
略

### 2.2
#### Q 
Exercises 12.2-2 Write recursive versions of the TREE-MINIMUM and TREE-MAXIMUM procedures.

#### A

```cpp
TREE-MINIMUM
	int min=0;
	assert(root);
	while(root)
		min =root->val;
		root =root->left;
	return min;
```
```cpp
TREE-MAXIMUM
	int max=0;
	assert(root);
	while(root)
		max =root->val;
		root =root->right;
	return max;
```

### 2.3
#### Q 
Write the TREE-PREDECESSOR procedure.
#### A
```cpp
TREE-PREDECESSOR 前继 左子树最大
	if(node->left)
		return TREE-MAXIMUM(node->left)
	y=node.parent
	while y!=nil and x=y.left
		x=y
		y=y.parent
	return y->val
```

### 2.4
#### Q 
Professor Bunyan thinks he has discovered a remarkable property of binary search trees. Suppose that the search for key k in a binary search tree ends up in a leaf. Consider three sets: A, the keys to the left of the search path; B, the keys on the search path; and C, the keys to the right of the search path. Professor Bunyan claims that any three keys a∈A, b∈B, and c∈C must satisfy a ≤ b ≤ c. Give a smallest possible counterexample to the professor’s claim.
#### A
路径上假设有两个节点a，b（a值小于b值）。b的左节点的值是有可能大于a的值的。

### 2.5
#### Q 
Show that if a node in a binary search tree has two children, then its successor has no left child and its predecessor has no right child.
#### A
因为它的前驱和后继都是它左子树的最大值和右子树的最小值，自然没有相应的左右孩子，不然就不满足这个条件。
### 2.6
#### Q 
Consider a binary search tree T whose keys are distinct. Show that if the right subtree of a node x in T is empty and x has a successor y, then y is the lowest ancestor of x whose left child is also an ancestor of x. (Recall that every node is its own ancestor.)
#### A
当x的右子树为空，那么二叉搜索树中可能比x大的只有作为x的祖先y，并且由于二叉搜索树的性质，x必须是其祖先y的右子树才能保证小于y，而且y是x最底层的祖先，就可以保证是后继。
### 2.7
#### Q 
inorder tree walk of an n-node binary search tree can be implemented by finding the minimum element in the tree with TREE-MINIMUM and then making n − 1 calls to TREE- SUCCESSOR. Prove that this algorithm runs in Θ(n)time.
#### A
讲道理，这其实就是中序遍历，而且每个节点最多被遍历2次，故Θ(n)time
### 2.8
#### Q 
Prove that no matter what node we start at in a height-h binary search tree, k successive calls to TREE-SUCCESSOR take O(k + h) time.
#### A
没想清楚
### 2.9
#### Q 
Let T be a binary search tree whose keys are distinct, let x be a leaf node, and let y be its parent. Show that key[y] is either the smallest key in T larger than key[x] or the largest key in T smaller than key[x].
#### A
由于x是叶子节点，故成立
