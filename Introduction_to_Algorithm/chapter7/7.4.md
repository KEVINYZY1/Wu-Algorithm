### 4.2
#### Q 
Show that quicksort's best-case running time is Ω(nlgn).
#### A
T (n) = 2T(n/2) + Θ(n)，根据主定理，易证
### 4.3
#### Q 
Show that q^2 +(n-q-1)^2 achieves a maximum over q = 0,1,...,n-1 when q=0 or q=n-1.

#### A
求导
### 4.4
#### Q 
Show that RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT's expected running time is Ω(n lg n).

#### A
书p103
### 4.5
#### Q 
The running time of quicksort can be improved in practice by taking advantage of the fast running time of insertion sort when its input is "nearly" sorted. When quicksort is called on a subarray with fewer than k elements, let it simply return without sorting the subarray. After the top-level call to quicksort returns, run insertion sort on the entire array to finish the sorting process. Argue that this sorting algorithm runs in O(nk + nlg(n/k)) expected time. How should k be picked, both in theory and in practice?

#### A
高度为lgk的时候，停止了快排。然后快排运行了lgn-lgk层，故时间复杂度应该是O(nlgn/k)。然后在个数小于k的子序列里面使用插入排序，O((k)^2 *n/k)=O(nk)。故总的时间复杂度是O(nk + nlg(n/k))。  
至于k取多少，stl里面混合版的sort，k值取得是16
### 4.6
#### Q 
Consider modifying the PARTITION procedure by randomly picking three elements from array A and partitioning about their median (the middle value of the three elements). Approximate the probability of getting at worst an α-to-(1 - α) split, as a function of α in the range 0 < α < 1.
#### A
这里选取主元的方案，也被stl的sort采用了
