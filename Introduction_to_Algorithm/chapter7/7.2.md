# chapter 7

## 练习2
### 2.1
#### Q 
Use the substitution method to prove that the recurrence T (n) = T (n - 1) + Θ(n) has the solution T (n) = Θ(n^2 ), as claimed at the beginning of Section 7.2.
#### A 
懒得用，递归树法比较方便
### 2.2
#### Q 
What is the running time of QUICKSORT when all elements of array A have the same value?
#### A
这种情况下，递归式T (n) = T (n - 1) + Θ(n)。  
故T (n) = Θ(n^2 )  

### 2.3
#### Q 
Show that the running time of QUICKSORT is Θ(n^2) when the array A contains distinct elements and is sorted in decreasing order.
#### A
输入数组是递增、递减或者全部元素相同。这三种情况下，都是快速排序的最坏情况。

### 2.4
#### Q 
Banks often record transactions on an account in order of the times of the transactions, but many people like to receive their bank statements with checks listed in order by check number. People usually write checks in order by check number, and merchants usually cash them with reasonable dispatch. The problem of converting time-of-transaction ordering to check-number ordering is therefore the problem of sorting almost-sorted input. Argue that the procedure INSERTION-SORT would tend to beat the procedure QUICKSORT on this problem.
#### A
插入排序特点，输入的数组逆序对越少，则交换次数越少，排序速度越快。  
而快速排序，面对输入数组有序的情况，要大量交换以此分组。主要是分组算法中，将主元选为了最后一个，故不能有效的分组。效率反而不如插入排序。

### 2.5
#### Q 
Suppose that the splits at every level of quicksort are in the proportion 1 - α to α, where 0 < α ≤ 1/2 is a constant. Show that the minimum depth of a leaf in the recursion tree is approximately - lg n/ lg α and the maximum depth is approximately -lg n/ lg(1 - α). (Don't worry about integer round-off.)
#### A
n*α^x <=1 可得 最小深度-lgn/lgα  
n*(1-α)^x <=1 可得 最大深度-lgn/lg(1-α)  
### 2.6
#### Q 
Argue that for any constant 0 < α ≤ 1/2, the probability is approximately 1 - 2α that on a random input array, PARTITION produces a split more balanced than 1-α to α.
#### A
比例比1-α:α更好，则新的α要在1-α到α之间。这样的α概率是1-2α。（α在0到0.5之间）
