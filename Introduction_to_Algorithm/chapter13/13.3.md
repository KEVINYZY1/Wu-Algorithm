## 练习3
### 3.1
#### Q 
In line 16 of RB-INSERT, we set the color of the newly inserted node z to red. Notice that if we had chosen to set z's color to black, then property 4 of a red-black tree would not be violated. Why didn't we choose to set z's color to black?
#### A
插入节点设为黑色，那么性质5会被破坏，相比较性质4，性质5更难修复。

### 3.2
#### Q 
Show the red-black trees that result after successively inserting the keys 41, 38, 31, 12, 19, 8 into an initially empty red-black tree.

#### A
[38黑，19红，41黑，12黑，31黑，nil，nil，8红]

### 3.3
#### Q 

Suppose that the black-height of each of the subtrees α, β, γ, δ, ε in Figures 13.5 and 13.6 is k. Label each node in each figure with its black-height to verify that property 5 is preserved by the indicated transformation.
#### A
 左旋或者右旋之后，都有涂色，保证了符合性质5
 
### 3.4
#### Q 

Professor Teach is concerned that RB-INSERT-FIXUP might set color[nil[T]] to RED, in which case the test in line 1 would not cause the loop to terminate when z is the root. Show that the professor's concern is unfounded by arguing that RB-INSERT-FIXUP never sets color[nil[T]] to RED.
#### A
每次改颜色的时候，都不会误改nil的颜色
### 3.5
#### Q 
Consider a red-black tree formed by inserting n nodes with RB-INSERT. Argue that if n > 1, the tree has at least one red node.
#### A
n=1，只有一个根节点是黑色，然后再插入就是红色。之后不论怎么改变，红色的个数至少是1.
### 3.6
#### Q 
Suggest how to implement RB-INSERT efficiently if the representation for red-black trees includes no storage for parent pointers.
#### A
那在fix之前，得用一个数组之类的来保存插入过程中经历的节点。
