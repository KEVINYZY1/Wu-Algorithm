# chapter 10

## 练习3
### 3.1
#### Q 
Draw a picture of the sequence[13, 4, 8, 19, 5, 11]stored as a doubly linked list using the multiple-array representation. Do the same for the single-array representation.
#### A
略

### 3.2
#### Q 
Write the procedures ALLOCATE-OBJECT and FREE-OBJECT for a homogeneous collection of objects implemented by the single-array representation.
#### A
```
ALLOCATE-OBJECT
if free==NIL
	return false
else 
	x=free
	free=A[x+1]
```  
```
FREE-OBJECT
	A[x+1]=free
	free=x
```
### 3.3
#### Q 
Why don't we need to set or reset the prev fields of objects in the implementation of the ALLOCATE-OBJECT and FREE-OBJECT procedures?
#### A
维护空闲的序列，就像维护一个栈，不需要前驱指针

### 3.4
#### Q 
It is often desirable to keep all elements of a doubly linked list compact in storage, using, for example, the first m index locations in the multiple-array representation. (This is the case in a paged, virtual-memory computing environment.) Explain how the procedures ALLOCATE>- OBJECT and FREE-OBJECT can be implemented so that the representation is compact. Assume that there are no pointers to elements of the linked list outside the list itself. (Hint: Use the array implementation of a stack.)
#### A
ALLOCATE-OBJECT时，假设链表是紧凑的，从下一个紧靠的数组位置来分配。  
FREE-OBJECT时，假设链表被删除后出现了一个空位，然后从最后一个元素移过来填补它。

### 3.5
#### Q 
Let L be a doubly linked list of length m stored in arrays key, prev, and next of length n. Suppose that these arrays are managed by ALLOCATE-OBJECT and FREE-OBJECT procedures that keep a doubly linked free list F. Suppose further that of the n items, exactly m are on list L and n-m are on the free list. Write a procedure COMPACTIFY-LIST(L, F) that, given the list L and the free list F, moves the items in L so that they occupy array positions 1, 2,..., m and adjusts the free list F so that it remains correct, occupying array positions m + 1, m + 2,..., n. The running time of your procedure should be Θ(n), and it should use only a constant amount of extra space. Give a careful argument for the correctness of your procedure.
#### A
标记空闲序列的每个节点中的prev，因为prev在空闲序列中都是空，所以可以放心标记，作为快速识别空闲节点的方法。  
然后在数组两头采用双指针，一旦左边的指针指向的时空闲序列，就与右边指向链表节点的互换，注意调整prev和next。  
最后整理全部在右边的空闲序列。
