## 练习2
### 2.1
#### Q 
Can the dynamic-set operation INSERT be implemented on a singly linked list in O(1) time? How about DELETE?

#### A
要看具体情况，指定地方插入自然是O(1)操作。删除如果不知道删除位置，那还得遍历，则不是O(1)操作。

### 2.2
#### Q
Implement a stack using a singly linked list L. The operations PUSH and POP should still take O(1) time.

#### A
很简单，插入和删除都在链表头。

### 2.3
#### Q
Implement a queue by a singly linked list L. The operations ENQUEUE and DEQUEUE should still take O(1) time.

#### A
插入链表头，删除在链表尾。
### 2.4
#### Q
As written, each loop iteration in the LIST-SEARC′ procedure requires two tests: one for x ≠ nil[L] and one for key[x] ≠ k. Show how to eliminate the test for x ≠ nil[L] in each iteration.
#### A
可以将哨兵值L的key设为k，这样哪怕key为k的节点不在链表中，搜索到最后的哨兵值，也可以照样跳出循环。

### 2.5
#### Q
Implement the dictionary operations INSERT, DELETE, and SEARCH using singly linked, circular lists. What are the running times of your procedures?
#### A
插入O（1），删除O（n），搜索O（N）。

### 2.6
#### Q
The dynamic-set operation UNION takes two disjoint sets S1 and S2 as input, and it returns a set S = S1 U S2 consisting of all the elements of S1 and S2. The sets S1 and S2 are usually destroyed by the operation. Show how to support UNION in O(1) time using a suitable list data structure.

#### A
已经是互不相交的两个集合，直接连在一起即可

### 2.7
#### Q
Give a Θ(n)-time nonrecursive procedure that reverses a singly linked list of n elements. The procedure should use no more than constant storage beyond that needed for the list itself.
#### A

### 2.8
#### Q
Explain how to implement doubly linked lists using only one pointer value np[x] per item instead of the usual two (next and prev). Assume that all pointer values can be interpreted as k-bit integers, and define np[x] to be np[x] = next[x] XOR prev[x], the k-bit "exclusive-or" of next[x] and prev[x]. (The value NIL is represented by 0.) Be sure to describe what information is needed to access the head of the list. Show how to implement the SEARCH, INSERT, and DELETE operations on such a list. Also show how to reverse such a list in O(1) time.

#### A
已知指向头尾节点的指针，利用异或性质可以获得每个节点的前后指针。逆转链表，直接头尾指针互换即可。
