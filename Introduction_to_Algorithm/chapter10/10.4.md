## 练习4
### 4.1
#### Q 
Draw the binary tree rooted at index 6 that is represented by the following fields.

#### A 
略
### 4.2
#### Q 
Write an O(n)-time recursive procedure that, given an n-node binary tree, prints out the key of each node in the tree.
#### A 
前序，中序，后序，皆可。

### 4.3
#### Q
Write an O(n)-time nonrecursive procedure that, given an n-node binary tree, prints out the key of each node in the tree. Use a stack as an auxiliary data structure. 

 
#### A 
[code](https://github.com/swananan/Wu-Algorithm/blob/master/Leetcode/145_BinaryTreePostorderTraversal.cc)  
层次遍历。一般用队列作为辅助数据结构。  
然而前中后序遍历，迭代实现，需要用到栈作为辅助结构。
### 4.4
#### Q
Write an O(n)-time procedure that prints all the keys of an arbitrary rooted tree with n nodes, where the tree is stored using the left-child, right-sibling representation.
#### A
```cpp
//左孩子右兄弟的任意根树遍历方法
inOrderTraversal(root)
if root->left exits
	orderTraversal(root ->left)
print root->val
if root->right exits
	orderTraversal(root ->right)
```
### 4.5
#### Q
Write an O(n)-time nonrecursive procedure that, given an n-node binary tree, prints out the key of each node. Use no more than constant extra space outside of the tree itself and do not modify the tree, even temporarily, during the procedure.
#### A
要求空间复杂度为O(1),则不能依赖栈或者队列来实现非递归的二叉树遍历。那么我们需要所给的二叉树可以从子节点回溯到父节点，才能实现非递归的遍历。

### 4.6
#### Q
The left-child, right-sibling representation of an arbitrary rooted tree uses three pointers in each node: left-child, right-sibling, and parent. From any node, its parent can be reached and identified in constant time and all its children can be reached and identified in time linear in the number of children. Show how to use only two pointers and one boolean value in each node so that the parent of a node or all of its children can be reached and identified in time linear in the number of children.
#### A
去掉parent指针,新增一个表示是否是最后一个儿子的bool值，如果是最后一个,那么next指向parent,否则next指向下一个兄弟节点
