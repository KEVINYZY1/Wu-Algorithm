## 练习2
###2.1
####Q
Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.
####A
淘宝按价格大小显示商品，应用了排序的算法

###2.2
####Q
Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the same machine. For inputs of size *n*, insertion sort runs in  8n<sup>2</sup> steps, while merge sort runs in *64nlgn* steps. For which values of n does insertion sort beat merge sort?
####A
n在(2,43)区间的时候，插入排序优于归并排序
###2.2
####Q
What is the smallest value of n such that an algorithm whose running time is  100n<sup>2</sup> runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is  on the same machine?
####A

n=15
