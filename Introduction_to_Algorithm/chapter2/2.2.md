## 练习2
### 2.1
#### Q  
Express the function *n<sup>3</sup>/1000-100n<sup>2</sup>-100n+3* in terms of Θ-notation.  
#### A  
Θ(n<sup>3</sup>)  
### 2.2
#### Q  
Consider sorting n numbers stored in array A by first finding the smallest element of A and exchanging it with the element in A[1]. Then find the second smallest element of A, and exchange it with A[2]. Continue in this manner for the first n - 1 elements of A. Write pseudocode for this algorithm, which is known as selection sort. What loop invariant does this algorithm maintain? Why does it need to run for only the first n-1 elements, rather than for all n elements? Give the best-case and worst-case running times of selection sort in Θ-notation.
#### A  
选择排序的伪代码 

```
for i=1 to length[A]-1
	min=i
	for j=i+1 to length[A]
		if A[j]<A[min]
		min=j
	temp=A[i]
	A[i]=A[min]
	A[min]=temp
```
选择排序

* 最好情况时间复杂度 O(n<sup>2</sup>)

* 最坏情况时间复杂度 O(n<sup>2</sup>)
  
### 2.3
#### Q  
Consider linear search again (see Exercise 2.1-3). How many elements of the input sequence need to be checked on the average, assuming that the element being searched for is equally likely to be any element in the array? How about in the worst case? What are the average-case and worst-case running times of linear search in Θ-notation? Justify your answers.

####A

* 线性查找一个长度为n的数组，平均情况下要检查n/2个元素
* 最坏情况是每个元素都要检测
* 最坏和平均情况的运行时间都为Θ(n) 

### 2.4
#### Q

How can we modify almost any algorithm to have a good best-case running time?

####A

假想最好的情况，看看有什么办法直接判断是最好情况，减少不必要的检测
