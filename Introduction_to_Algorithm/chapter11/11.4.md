## 练习4
### 4.1
#### Q 
Consider inserting the keys 10, 22, 31, 4, 15, 28, 17, 88, 59 into a hash table of length m = 11 using open addressing with the primary hash function h'(k) = k mod m. Illustrate the result of inserting these keys using linear probing, using quadratic probing with c1 = 1 and c2 = 3, and using double hashing with h2(k) = 1 + (k mod (m - 1)).
#### A
略

### 4.2
#### Q 
Write pseudocode for HASH-DELETE as outlined in the text, and modify HASH-INSERT to handle the special value DELETED.
#### A
```cpp
HASH-INSERT
 i = 0
 do{j <- h(k, i)
    if T[j] == NIL || T[j] == "DELETED":
        T[j] = k
        rteurn j
    else i = i + 1}
while( i < m);
error "hash table overflow"
```
```cpp
HASH-DELETE
 i = 0
 do{j <- h(k, i)
    if T[j] == k  
        T[j] = "DELETED"
        rteurn 
    else if T[j] == Nil
    	break
    else i = i + 1}
while( i < m);
error "hash table dont have k"
```

### 4.3
#### Q 
Consider an open-address hash table with uniform hashing. Give upper bounds on the expected number of probes in an unsuccessful search and on the expected number of probes in a successful search when the load factor is 3/4 and when it is 7/8.
#### A
书中p154已经给出结论，α = ¾,探查上界1 / (1 - ¾ )，需要4从次。α = 7/8,则需要 1 / (1-7/8) = 8次

### 4.4
#### Q 
Suppose that we use double hashing to resolve collisions; that is, we use the hash function h(k, i) = (h1(k)+ih2(k)) mod m. Show that if m and h2(k) have greatest common divisor d ≥ 1 for some key k, then an unsuccessful search for key k examines (1/d)th of the hash table before returning to slot h1(k). Thus, when d = 1, so that m and h2(k) are relatively prime, the search may examine the entire hash table. (Hint: See Chapter 31.)
