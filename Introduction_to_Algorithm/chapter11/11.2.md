## 练习2
### 2.1
#### Q 
Suppose we use a hash function h to hash n distinct keys into an array T of length m. Assuming simple uniform hashing, what is the expected number of collisions? More precisely, what is the expected cardinality of {{k, l} : k ≠ l and h(k) = h(l)}?
#### A
不会
### 2.2
#### Q 
Demonstrate the insertion of the keys 5, 28, 19, 15, 20, 33, 12, 17, 10 into a hash table with collisions resolved by chaining. Let the table have 9 slots, and let the hash function be h(k) = k mod 9.
#### A
用哈希函数算出关键值，碰撞就用链表解决。

### 2.3
#### Q 
Professor Marley hypothesizes that substantial performance gains can be obtained if we modify the chaining scheme so that each list is kept in sorted order. How does the professor's modification affect the running time for successful searches, unsuccessful searches, insertions, and deletions?
#### A
不成功查找会受益，有可能提前预判不在链表中。  
插入操作会麻烦一点，一旦碰撞，需要保证链表有序插入。

### 2.4
#### Q
Suggest how storage for elements can be allocated and deallocated within the hash table itself by linking all unused slots into a free list. Assume that one slot can store a flag and either one element plus a pointer or two pointers. All dictionary and free-list operations should run in O(1) expected time. Does the free list need to be doubly linked, or does a singly linked free list suffice?

#### A
空闲链表需要双链表来实现，因为空闲的槽位是由哈希函数决定的，不一定是连续的，为了方便删除插入，需要双链表。

### 2.5
#### Q
Show that if |U| > nm, there is a subset of U of size n consisting of keys that all hash to the same slot, so that the worst-case searching time for hashing with chaining is Θ(n).

#### A
因为|U| > nm，则必然会有大小为n的集合，隐射到同一个槽位中。
### 2.5
#### Q
Suppose we have stored n keys in a hash table of size m, with collisions resolved by chaining, and that we know the length of each chain, including the length L of the longest chain. Describe a procedure that selects a key uniformly at random from among the keys in the hash table and returns it in expected time O(L⋅(1+1/α)).
#### A
装载因子α =n/m，L为最长链长度，即L≥α。所以L(1+1/α)≥1+α。又因为成功查找期望时间为O(1 + a)，即 O(L⋅(1+1/α))。
