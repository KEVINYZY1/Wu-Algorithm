## 练习3
### 3.1
#### Q 
Suppose we wish to search a linked list of length n, where each element contains a key k along with a hash value h(k). Each key is a long character string. How might we take advantage of the hash values when searching the list for an element with a given key?

#### A
这里考虑到关键字是很长的字符串，依赖关键字来寻找，效率低下。我们可以将需要被查找的关键字转换为h(k)，然后查找表中的h(k)，来搜索。  

### 3.2
#### Q 
Suppose that a string of r characters is hashed into m slots by treating it as a radix-128 number and then using the division method. The number m is easily represented as a 32-bit computer word, but the string of r characters, treated as a radix-128 number, takes many words. How can we apply the division method to compute the hash value of the character string without using more than a constant number of words of storage outside the string itself?
#### A
书中所说的，将字符串转为自然数，把每个字符对应为一个数字，求出总和，再mod128即可。 

### 3.3
#### Q 
Consider a version of the division method in which h(k) = k mod m, where m = 2p - 1 and k is a character string interpreted in radix 2p. Show that if string x can be derived from string y by permuting its characters, then x and y hash to the same value. Give an example of an application in which this property would be undesirable in a hash function.
#### A
