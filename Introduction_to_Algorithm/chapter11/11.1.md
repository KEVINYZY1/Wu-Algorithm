# chapter 11

## 练习1
### 1.1
#### Q 
Suppose that a dynamic set S is represented by a direct-address table T of length m. Describe a procedure that finds the maximum element of S. What is the worst-case performance of your procedure?

#### A
遍历长度为m的直接寻址表T，时间复杂度O(m)  

### 1.2
#### Q 
A bit vector is simply an array of bits (0's and 1's). A bit vector of length m takes much less space than an array of m pointers. Describe how to use a bit vector to Represent a Dynamic Set of Distinct Elements with no Satellite Data. Dictionary Operations Should Run in O(1) Time.
#### A
这样只能存放元素为数字的动态集合，下标即元素，至于位向量里面的值0和1分别代表该元素是否存在在集合中。

### 1.3
#### Q 
Suggest how to implement a direct-address table in which the keys of stored elements do not need to be distinct and the elements can have satellite data. All three dictionary operations (INSERT, DELETE, and SEARCH) should run in O(1) time. (Don't forget that DELETE takes as an argument a pointer to an object to be deleted, not a key.)

#### A
由于表中元素的关键字有可能相同，故有可能碰撞，那么让直接寻址表的槽中指向一个链表，以应对碰撞的情况。

### 1.4
#### Q 
We wish to implement a dictionary by using direct addressing on a huge array. At the start, the array entries may contain garbage, and initializing the entire array is impractical because of its size. Describe a scheme for implementing a direct-address dictionary on a huge array. Each stored object should use O(1) space; the operations SEARCH, INSERT, and DELETE should take O(1) time each; and the initialization of the data structure should take O(1) time. (Hint: Use an additional stack, whose size is the number of keys actually stored in the dictionary, to help determine whether a given entry in the huge array is valid or not.)

#### A
使用一个非常大的数组作为直接寻址表，这样对该数组进行初始化会使得效率变得极为低下。在不初始化的情况下，如何确定大数组中元素是否已经被存放了动态集合的元素。  
我们按题目提示，使用栈作为辅助的数据结构。将要存放动态集合的元素值都放在栈中，而大数组用来存放元素在栈中的下标。这样可以确定大数组中元素是否已经被存放了动态集合的元素。
