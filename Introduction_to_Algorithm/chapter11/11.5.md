#### Q 
Suppose that we insert n keys into a hash table of size m using open addressing and uniform hashing. Let p(n, m) be the probability that no collisions occur. Show that p(n, m) ≤ e^(-n(n-1)/2m). (Hint: See equation (3.11).) Argue that when n exceeds sqrt(m), the probability of avoiding collisions goes rapidly to zero.
