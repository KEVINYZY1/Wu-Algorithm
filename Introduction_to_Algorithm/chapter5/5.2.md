## 练习2
### 2.1
####Q 
In HIRE-ASSISTANT, assuming that the candidates are presented in a random order, what is the probability that you will hire exactly one time? What is the probability that you will hire exactly n times?  
####A  
雇佣一次，1/n的概率(要求最好的雇佣者第一次出现)   
雇佣n次，1/n!的概率(要求被雇佣者按升序排列出现)

### 2.2
####Q  
In HIRE-ASSISTANT, assuming that the candidates are presented in a random order, what is the probability that you will hire exactly twice?
####A
一共有n个雇员，假设第一个雇员质量为k  
那么质量比第一个雇员高的雇员必须在质量最高的雇员之后，才能保证雇佣2次  
Pr{Tk}=1/n *1/(n-k)  
故p=Pr{T1}+Pr{T2}+...+Pr{Tn} 
### 2.3
####Q  
Use indicator random variables to compute the expected value of the sum of n dice.  
####A  
一个骰子的期望是（1+2+3+4+5+6）/6=3.5  
扔n个骰子期望 3.5n  
### 2.4
####Q  
Use indicator random variables to solve the following problem, which is known as the hat- check problem. Each of n customers gives a hat to a hat-check person at a restaurant. The hat- check person gives the hats back to the customers in a random order. What is the expected number of customers that get back their own hat?
####A
一个人拿到自己帽子的期望 1/n  
n个人拿到自己帽子的期望 1  
### 2.5
####Q  
Let A[1...n] be an array of n distinct numbers. If i < j and A[i] > A[j], then the pair (i, j) is called an inversion of A. (See Problem 2-4 for more on inversions.) Suppose that each element of A is chosen randomly, independently, and uniformly from the range 1 through n. Use indicator random variables to compute the expected number of inversions.

####A  
逆序对与正序对一一对应，而一共会有n(n-1)/2对两两序列  
故逆序对期望n(n-1)/4
