## 练习1
### 1.1
####Q
Show that the assumption that we are always able to determine which candidate is best, in line 4 of procedure HIRE-ASSISTANT, implies that we know a total order of the ranks of the candidates. 
####A
总能够决定哪一个应聘者最佳，故我们必然知道应聘者排名的全部次序。 
### 1.2
####Q
Describe an implementation of the procedure RANDOM(a, b) that only makes calls to RANDOM(0, 1). What is the expected running time of your procedure, as a function of a and b?

####A
```
RANDOM(a,b)
if(a==b)
	return a
int mid=(a+b)/2
r=RANDOM(0,1)  //题目中说，只可以调用RANDOM(0,1)
if(r==0)
	RANDOM(ceil(mid),b)
else
	RANDOM(a,floor(mid))
```
期望运行时间  O(lg(b-a))

### 1.3
####Q  
Suppose that you want to output 0 with probability 1/2 and 1 with probability 1/2. At your disposal is a procedure BIASED-RANDOM, that outputs either 0 or 1. It outputs 1 with some probability p and 0 with probability 1 - p, where 0 < p < 1, but you do not know what p is. Give an algorithm that uses BIASED-RANDOM as a subroutine, and returns an unbiased answer, returning 0 with probability 1/2 and 1 with probability 1/2. What is the expected running time of your algorithm as a function of p?

####A

如果同时调用BIASED-RANDOM,则01和10的概率都是p(1-p)，因此我们利用这个特性实现无偏移的随机算法   
```
UNBIASED-RANDOM()
while(true)
    a = BIASED-RANDOM();
    b = BIASED-RANDOM();
    if a==0 && b==1
         return 0;
    if a==1 && b==0
         return 1;
```
