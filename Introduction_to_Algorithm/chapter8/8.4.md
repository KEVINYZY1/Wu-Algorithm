## 练习4
### 4.1
#### Q 
Using Figure 8.4 as a model, illustrate the operation of BUCKET-SORT on the array A =[.79, .13, .16, .64, .39, .20, .89, .53, .71, .42]
#### A
略
### 4.2
#### Q 
What is the worst-case running time for the bucket-sort algorithm? What simple change to the algorithm preserves its linear expected running time and makes its worst-case running time O(n lg n)?
#### A
当所有的item都落在一个bucket内，是最坏情况，相当于对所有数据做一次插入排序，是O(n^2 )   
不用插入，用快排或者归并，leetcode上有这类题目[code](https://github.com/swananan/Wu-Algorithm/blob/master/Leetcode/148_SortList.cc)

### 4.3
#### Q 
Let X be a random variable that is equal to the number of heads in two flips of a fair coin. What is E [X^2]? What is E^2[X]?
#### A
概率论，都是1
### 4.4
#### Q 
We are given n points in the unit circle, pi=(xi,yi), such that 0<x2i+y2i≤1 for i=1,2,…,n. Suppose that the points are uniformly distributed; that is, the probability of finding a point in any region of the circle is proportional to the area of that region. Design an algorithm with an average-case running time of Θ(n) to sort the n points by their distances di=x2i+y2i−−−−−−√ from the origin. (Hint: Design the bucket sizes in BUCKET-SORT to reflect the uniform distribution of the points in the unit circle.)
#### A
桶排序n个数，由于在圆上是按面积均匀分布的，则把圆划分为n个均匀的圆环。然后判断n个点分别落在哪个圆环，再依次排序。
### 4.5
#### Q 
A probability distribution function P(x) for a random variable X is defined by P(x) = Pr {X ≤ x}. Suppose that a list of n random variables X1, X2, . . .,Xn is drawn from a continuous probability distribution function P that is computable in O(1) time. Show how to sort these numbers in linear expected time.
#### A
用桶排序
