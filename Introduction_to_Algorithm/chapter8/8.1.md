## 练习1
### 1.1
#### Q 
What is the smallest possible depth of a leaf in a decision tree for a comparison sort?

#### A
决策树的高度代表比较了多少次，如果已经是sorted的话，那么只需要n-1次的比较，就可以到底。故最小n-1

### 1.2
#### Q 
Obtain asymptotically tight bounds on \lg(n!) without using Stirling's approximation. Instead, evaluate the summation sum{k=1 to n} lg{k} using techniques from section A.2.
#### A
分别求sum{k=1 to n} lg{k}的渐进上界和渐进下界  
略
### 1.3
#### Q 
Show that there is no comparison sort whose running time is linear for at least half of the n! inputs of length n. What about a fraction of 1/n of the inputs of length n? What about a fraction 1/2^n?
#### A
即决策树有没有一半的叶子节点高度在O(n)。答案是没有。  
这样会要求n!/n<=2^n  这是不成立的。
### 1.4
#### Q 
You are given a sequence of n elements to sort. The input sequence consists of n/k subsequences, each containing k elements. The elements in a given subsequence are all smaller than the elements in the succeeding subsequence and larger than the elements in the preceding subsequence. Thus, all that is needed to sort the whole sequence of length n is to sort the k elements in each of the n/k subsequences. Show an Ω(n lg k) lower bound on the number of comparisons needed to solve this variant of the sorting problem. (Hint: It is not rigorous to simply combine the lower bounds for the individual subsequences.)
#### A
长度为k的子序列排序需要O(klgk)的时间，一共有n/k个子序列，另外由题意省去了归并的时间，那么就总共需要O(nlgk)时间。
