# chapter 8

## 练习3
### 3.1
#### Q 
Using Figure 8.3 as a model, illustrate the operation of RADIX-SORT on the following list of English words: COW, DOG, SEA, RUG, ROW, MOB, BOX, TAB, BAR, EAR, TAR, DIG, BIG, TEA, NOW, FOX.
#### A
从最右边向最左边依次排序
### 3.2
#### Q 
Which of the following sorting algorithms are stable: insertion sort, merge sort, heapsort, and quicksort? Give a simple scheme that makes any sorting algorithm stable. How much additional time and space does your scheme entail?
#### A
插入排序和归并排序是稳定的。  
堆排序和快速排序是不稳定的。  
在排序前，给所有元素一个额外的index值，排完序之后，用插入排序按照index值再排一遍。利用了插入排序对近似排好序的数组效率高以及插入排序是稳定排序的特点。  
额外时间和空间开销都是O(n)!
### 3.3 
#### Q 
Use induction to prove that radix sort works. Where does your proof need the assumption that the intermediate sort is stable?
#### A 
略
### 3.4
#### Q 
Show how to sort n integers in the range 0 to n^2 - 1 in O(n) time.

Note: In 3rd Edition, the number range is 0 to n^3 - 1, the basic idea is same
#### A 
基数排序

### 3.5
#### Q
In the first card-sorting algorithm in this section, exactly how many sorting passes are needed to sort d-digit decimal numbers in the worst case? How many piles of cards would an operator need to keep track of in the worst case?
#### A 
从高位开始排序的话，会导致对无法区分大小的部分分到几个容器中继续排序。这样递归下去，最坏情况，时间复杂度会是指数级别的。
